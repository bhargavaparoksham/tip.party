# Tip.party

## About
Tip Party allows you to easily drop any ERC-20 token to contributors of a DAO. You can become a distributor, and load up a Tip Party room, where contributors can sign into with their Ethereum wallets to receive tokens.

Tip Party works best when rewarding members on community calls! Please check out [our landing page](https://tip.party) for more information.
